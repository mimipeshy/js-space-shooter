# Alien Shooters - Javascript Phaser 3 Game 
> In this project, we were required to build a space shooter game with the Phaser Javascript library.
> <br>

> The player will have to kill different types of enemies with AI functionality. He can also pick droppings to increase his weapon level/lives or to enter in shield mode.
> <br>

> The game currently has 7 levels (from which one is a Boss and the last one has an infinite spawn). The player can reach a maximum of 5 extra lives and level 7 laser.
> <br>

> The game is tested using Jest for unit testing

2. Install dependencies (only if you did not install them previously):

   `npm install`

3. Run the tests with the command:

   `npm test`

## Retrospective:
After developing the game and looking back at the initial plan, conceived on the second day these are some reflections about my development.

What went wrong? Overall, I assume Phaser would be easier. It's documentation is confusing and not cohesive enough. 

This meant a lot of time was invested in googling how to work around specific things, such as animations and implementing scenes. This was not easy at all and very time consuming. The provided examples and tutorial didn't seem enough.

What went well? Creating the game itself went really well..

## Future improvements
- Make the game playable on mobiles
- Add other worlds/levels/enemies
